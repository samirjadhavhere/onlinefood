I developed a project to run CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python, SQL, Django, HTML, and CSS. This project involved designing and implementing a robust database management system, enabling users to perform essential database operations efficiently. Leveraging Django's powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), I streamlined database interactions and ensured data integrity. I also created a user-friendly web interface with HTML and CSS, making it easy for users to interact with the database through intuitive forms and views. This project showcases my proficiency in Python, SQL, Django, and frontend technologies, demonstrating my ability to develop comprehensive, full-stack solutions for data management and manipulation
